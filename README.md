# SelfDrivingCar
Courseware &amp; Homework of Udacity's Self Drving Car NanoDegree,Let's go change the world!
## Update
- I'm runing & Setting up the project in Unbuntu 16.04. Setting up environment is time killing if you are not familiar with linux world.
- Be sure to install pip and conda staff under root (sudo -s), otherwise IO permission will be blocked (sheer $sudo dosen't work, do direct to # )
- Switching to windows using docker image
